# Stock Analysis with Bollinger Bands and RSI

## Overview

This project provides an in-depth stock analysis tool that allows users to analyze individual stocks or entire sectors using technical indicators such as Bollinger Bands and the Relative Strength Index (RSI). The tool fetches historical stock data, calculates technical indicators, and visualizes the results through interactive charts using Plotly.

## Features

- **Sector-Based Analysis**: Analyze the performance of a specific sector by selecting a sector and viewing the combined stock performance of its components.
- **Bollinger Bands**: Calculate and visualize Bollinger Bands to determine potential overbought or oversold conditions.
- **RSI (Relative Strength Index)**: Calculate and visualize the RSI to assess the momentum of stocks and identify overbought or oversold conditions.
- **Interactive Charts**: Visualize stock data and indicators with interactive candlestick charts and RSI plots using Plotly.
- **Custom Timeframes**: Choose from predefined timeframes (1 Day, 5 Days, 1 Month, etc.) or enter a custom date range for analysis.

## Prerequisites

Before running the project, make sure you have the following Python libraries installed:

- `pandas`
- `yfinance`
- `plotly`
- `datetime`

You can install these libraries using pip:

```bash
pip install pandas yfinance plotly
```

## Setup

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/stock-analysis.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd stock-analysis
   ```

3. Make sure you have the `sectors.csv` file, which contains the sectors and their corresponding stock tickers. This file should be in the root directory of the project.

## Usage

### Sector Analysis

1. Run the script:

   ```bash
   python stock_analysis.py
   ```

2. The program will prompt you to select a sector and timeframe. Choose a sector and a timeframe for analysis.
3. The program will fetch the stock data for all tickers in the selected sector and display combined charts for Bollinger Bands and RSI.

### Individual Stock Analysis

1. After analyzing a sector, the program will prompt you to analyze an individual stock.
2. Enter the stock ticker symbol (e.g., AAPL, TSLA).
3. The program will fetch the data for the selected stock and display its Bollinger Bands and RSI charts.

### Timeframe Options

You can select from the following predefined timeframes:

- 1 Day (1d)
- 5 Days (5d)
- 1 Month (1mo)
- 3 Months (3mo)
- 6 Months (6mo)
- Year-to-Date (ytd)
- 1 Year (1y)
- 2 Years (2y)
- 5 Years (5y)
- Custom Date Range (YYYY-MM-DD to YYYY-MM-DD)

### Example

```bash
Choose the timeframe for analysis:
1. 1 Day (1d)
2. 5 Days (5d)
3. 1 Month (1mo)
...
Enter your choice: 1
```

## Output

- **Candlestick Chart**: Displays the price movement of the stock over the selected timeframe, with Bollinger Bands (Upper, Lower, and SMA) plotted.
- **RSI Chart**: Displays the Relative Strength Index, with overbought (70) and oversold (30) levels marked.

## Combined Sector Analysis Verdict

After analyzing a sector, the program will provide a combined verdict based on the Bollinger Bands and RSI indicators:

- **Investable (Oversold)**: Indicates that the stock/sector is oversold and might be a good investment opportunity.
- **Not Investable (Overbought)**: Indicates that the stock/sector is overbought and might not be a good investment opportunity.
- **Neutral**: Indicates that the stock/sector is neither overbought nor oversold.
